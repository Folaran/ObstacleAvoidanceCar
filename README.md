# ObstacleAvoidanceCar

The obstacle avoidance car uses sensors to send sounds waves back and forth, and measures the distance between a potential distance. It avoids the obstacle by stopping the car and steering in the difference direction. The distance at which it does this is based on the number put in the Arduino code.
